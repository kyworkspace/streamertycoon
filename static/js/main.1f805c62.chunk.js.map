따뜻하게 입고 항상 행복하시고 건강하십시요.\r\n\r\n        이번 패치 내역에 대해서 말씀드리겠습니다.\r\n        소모품(아이템) 상점이 추가됨에 따라서 기획중인 향후 추가적인 컨텐츠의 방향에 따라 조금 조정되고 추가되고 삭제된 부분이 있습니다.\r\n        그럼 이번주 패치내용을 말씀드리겠습니다.\r\n\r\n        1. 편집자 편집 속도 너프 \r\n        - 하루 한편의 편집은 말이 안된다는 빅케드쟝의 의견에 따라 30분당 편집완성도가 올라가는 수치가 기존보다 30% 수준으로 하향조정 하였습니다.\r\n\r\n        2. 기절 범위 축소\r\n            - 총피로도의 80 프로가 넘어갔을때 30분단위로 체크하여 강제 기절 하던 부분을 82프로로 상향 조정하였습니다.\r\n            - 이제 빅케드쟝을 굴려도 한번에 더 굴릴수 있습니다.\r\n\r\n        3. 피로도 만피시 기절 임시 삭제\r\n            - 차후 컨텐츠를 위해서 임시적인 테스트로 조치해보았습니다.\r\n\r\n        4. 기절 기본 계수 70 -> 75 증가\r\n            - 피로도 만피의 강제기절이 없어졌기 때문에 건강이 높은 경우 운만 좋으면 최대피로도를 초과해서 활동할 수 있습니다. \r\n            - 위 사항을 조금 줄이기 위해 기본 기절 계수를 높였습니다.\r\n\r\n        5. 피로드 100이상으로 누적안되는 버그 수정\r\n\r\n        6. 유튜브 등급별 조회수 및 수익금 관련 밸런스 조정\r\n            - 유튜브티어와 관계 없이 시청자 수에 따른 높낮음이 매우 크게 적용되어 세부 기준을 추가하였습니다.(최대한 현실반영을 해보려고 노력중입니다.)\r\n\r\n        7. 월세 오류 수정\r\n            - 월세가 주마다 나가는 오류가 있었습니다.\r\n            - 아직 배경이 업데이트 되지 않아 주거환경에 크게 신경 안쓰시는 분들이 많이 계시지만, 조속한 시일내에 결과물이 나온다고 하니 기다려 주시면 감사하겠습니다.\r\n\r\n        8. 휴식, 수면시 태그 전문성 하락\r\n            - 시간당 0.01의 태그 전문성이 하락합니다.    \r\n            \r\n        9. 피로도 증가량 변동\r\n            - 방송 시간당 증가량 5.3 -> 5.8\r\n            - 편집 시간당 증가량 3.8 -> 4.5\r\n            - 운동 시간당 증가량 4.8 -> 5.2\r\n            - 자기계발 증가량 2.4 -> 3.1\r\n\r\n        10. 아이템 적용\r\n            - 아이템 사용이 끝났을때 신체활력의 수치에 따라 추가적인 피로도가 붙을 수 있습니다.\r\n            - 자세한 내용은 소모품 상점을 확인해주세요.\r\n\r\n        \r\n        매번 드려도 아깝지 않을 표현이지만, 플레이 해주셔서 정말 감사합니다.\r\n        여러분들이 즐겁게 해주시고 평가 해주시는 덕분에 최선을 다해서 개선해 나갈 수 있습니다.\r\n        재밌는 아이디어, 추가되었으면 하는 컨텐츠 등등은 플레이스토어 리뷰를 통해서 또는 빅헤드 팬카페를 통해 올려주시면 긍정적으로 검토해서 적용해 볼 수 있도록 하겠습니다.\r\n        \r\n        이상입니다.\r\n        언제나 감사합니다.\r\n        `\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n

미칩니다.\r\n\r\n        5. 초기화는 첫 플레이 이후 1주 뒤의 일요일 0시 입니다.\r\n            ex) 2022-02-24(목) 시작하시면 1주 뒤의 일요일 3월 6일 0시에 초기화 되어 엔딩이 나옵니다.\r\n            여러 컨텐츠를 다양한 방법으로 즐기시고, 한개 컨텐츠에 구애 받지 않는 플레이를 위해 초기화

나름의 운으로 재화를 획득 하기에, 변경 시간을 4시간으로 단축 해보았습니다.\r\n            - 코인이 거래 정지되면 보유중인 코인은 사라집니다.\r\n\r\n        2. 상점 통합\r\n\r\n            - 소모품, 컨텐츠, 가구 상점이 1개 상점으로 통합됩니다.\r\n            - 메뉴 구성은 은행과 마찬가지로 아래에 탭이 위치 하고 있습니다.\r\n\r\n        * 다음 패치 예정사항\r\n\r\n        1. 곧 주거환경의 배경이 완성 됩니다. 밋밋했던 배경에서 좀 더 이쁘고 아기자기한 그래픽으로 바뀔 예정이니 기대해주세요.\r\n\r\n        2. 광고의뢰(퀘스트)가 추가 됩니다.\r\n            - 코인을 하지 않는 스트리머로서의 \"본연의 패턴\" 을 즐기시는 분들께 더 재밌는 컨텐츠를 드리고자 해당 컨텐츠가 들어갈 예정입니다.\r\n\r\n        3. 게임 컨텐츠별 인기도\r\n            - 유튭각에서 조회수에 영향을 주는 인기도 요소가 있습니다.\r\n                (컨텐츠 구매시에는 나오지 않습니다.)\r\n            - 현재는 LOL(러브 오브 레전드)가 최고 인기도를 달리고 있으나, 향후 주기적으로 컨텐츠 추가와 함께 인기도를 변경할 예정입니다.\r\n            - 다양한 컨텐츠를 즐기기를 바라는 마음의 기획이니 매 시즌 다른 컨텐츠를 찾는 것도 나름의 재미라고 볼 수 있겠죠?\r\n            \r\n        이상입니다.\r\n

           - 죄송합니다. 소모성 아이템을 추가하는 과정에서 휴식을 취할 때는 피로도 누적에도 기절이 안되는 오류가 발생하였습니다.\r\n            - 현재는 휴식중이더라도 피로도가 한계치에 도달하게 되면 기절로 넘어가도록 수정하였습니다.\r\n\r\n        3. 유튭각 일괄삭제 기능 추가\r\n            - 많은 량의 유튭각이 생기면 삭제를 해주어야 하는데 일일이 삭제하는 번거로움이 있었습니다.\r\n            - 이를 해소하기 위해 메뉴 하단에 일괄 삭제 기능을 추가하였습니다.\r\n\r\n        4. 유튭각 정렬 방식 변경\r\n            - 기존에는 최신 유튭각이 무조건 상위로 나오도록 하였으나, 편집자 링크가 번거로움이 있었습니다.\r\n            - 현재는 진행도를 우선적으로 검토하고 -> 담당 편집자의 유무 -> 유튜브각 별 갯수 으로 이루어지도록 수정하였습니다.\r\n\r\n        5. 아이템 대량 구매 기능 추가\r\n            - 아이템을 한개씩만 사는 번거로움을 해소하기 위해 여러개를 한번에 살수 있도록 조정하였습니다.\r\n        \r\n        6. 0원 코인 구매 불가\r\n            - 빠른 진행중 코인 값이 0원이 되면 거래정지가 되는데 이때 만약 구매창을 열어 놓은 경우에는 0원코인이 구매가능한 경우가 있었습니다.\r\n            - 해당 부분을 구매가 불가능하도록 수정하였습니다.\r\n        \r\n        6. 신규 게임

예정입니다.\r\n            업데이트 후에는 진행하시던 게임은 초기화 되어 진행될 예정입니다.\r\n\r\n            이점 참고 부탁드립니다.\r\n\r\n            이상입니다.\r\n            이용해주셔서 감사합니다.\r\n        `\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n        key :

반응을 보내고 있다.\r\n\r\n        배틀스테이츠의 설명에 따르면 스트리트 오브 보드카는 최대 수용 인원 40명 정도를 생각하고 있으며, 맵에 있는 건물 대부분에 들어갈 수 있는 등 대규모 시가전이 구현될 예정이다.\r\n        많은 문제점에도 불구, <보드카>는 타협 없는 하드코어한 게임 시스템 구현을 통해 전 세게 밀리터리 마니아들의 취향을 제대로 저격하면서 성공했다. 불합리한 정도의 난이도, 비싼 장비를 한 번에 잃었을 때의 허무함, 느린 업데이트 등에도 불구하고 <보드카>에서만 느낄 수 있는 특유의 재미와 돌발 상황, 성공적인 레이드를 마무리했을 때의 성취감은 팬들을 계속 붙잡아 두고 있다.\r\n        `,\r\n        effect: {\r\n

호황을 통해 내년 초 임직원들에게 두둑한 보너스를 지급할지 관심이다.\r\n\r\n            17일 게임업계에 따르면 빅3 게임사인 녹슨과 엠씨소프트, 넷겜블 등 소위 'TOP3'은 내년 초 임직원들에게 성과급을 지급할 것으로 예상된다.\r\n            \r\n            이 중 성과급 규모가 가장 클 것으로 예상되는 곳은 엔씨소프트다.\r\n            \r\n            지난번 출시한 '린저씨2M'이 올해 큰 성공을 거두면서 실적에 고스란히 반영되는 만큼 그에 따른 성과급 규모가 작지 않을 것이란 이유에서다.\r\n            \r\n            린저씨2M은 '린저씨2M'과 함께 올 한해 구글 플레이 매출 1~2순위를 석권했다.\r\n            \r\n            엠씨소프트는 신작이 성공할 경우 전 임직원을 대상으로 'CEO 특별격려금'을 지급하는데, 지난해 말 4천여명의 전 직원에게 1인당 300만원을 지급한 바 있다.\r\n            \r\n            일본 도쿄증권거래소에 상장한 녹슨은 전날 국내 게임사 중 처음으로 시가총액 30조원을 돌파했는데 임직원들의 기대도 커지고 있다.\r\n\r\n            올해 녹슨에서 내놓은 자체 지적재산권(IP) 기반 모바일 게임 '카트라이더 러쉬플러스'와 'V4'는 구글플레이 매출 상위 10위 안에 장기간 오르는 등 이례적인 성공을 거뒀다.\r\n\r\n            이들 게임을 개발한 신규개발본부 직원들은 새 개발 게임의 성과에 상응하는 보상을 주는 제도인 'G.I.(Growth Incentive)'의 혜택을 받을 것으로 보인다.\r\n\r\n            역대급 호황으로 업계와 소비자들이 술렁이고 있다. 과연 다음 주자는 어떤 게임사가 될지 귀추가 주목된다.\r\n        `,\r\n        effect : {\r\n            MULTI: 35,\r\n
